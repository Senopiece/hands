// Each element represents a camera:
//   index - the camera id matching --cam argument of test script
//   focus - camera focus in hardware specific units
//   size - frame size in pixels to capture
//   fps - the target fps the camera is supposed to capture frames at
//   track: "full", "fingers", "palm", "back" - the mode at which hand captured by this camera will be used in trinagulation

// NOTE: .def. is used by calibration script to generate .calib.
//       capture script will use values only from .calib. file

// NOTE: changing focus and size requires full recalibration
//       but fps and track can be rewritten without recalibration (you can modify it directly in the .calib. file)
